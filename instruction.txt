I'll explain with long position (short position is opposite)

== Strategy 1

1) Entry condition
- Current volume amount should be BIGGER than average past 21 volume amount, in the market.
	volume > avrg * 1.5
- Close price should be CROSS OVER the trend trader curve
	crossover(close,ret)
- Close price should be bigger than EMA(200)
	close>ema
- Close price should be bigger than EMA(800)
	close>ema2
- Current position should be flat
	sps==0
2) Exit condition (stop loss is updated)
- The INITIAL STOP LOSS is the high price of the bar before the entry bar.
- When close price increases, so 99% of close price is bigger than stop loss, then update stop loss by 99% of close price. So stop loss increases.
- When price meet stop loss, then exit 100% of position.

== Strategy 2

1) Entry condition
- Current volume amount should be BIGGER than average past 21 volume amount, in the market.
	volume > avrg * 1.5
- Close price should be CROSS OVER the trend trader curve
	crossover(close,ret)
- Close price should be smaller than EMA(200)
	close < ema
- Close price should be bigger than EMA(800)
	close > ema2
- Current position should be flat
	sps==0

2) Exit condition (stop loss is updated)
- The INITIAL STOP LOSS is the high price of the bar before the entry bar.
- When close price increases, so 99% of close price is bigger than stop loss and EMA 200, then update stop loss by 99% of close price. So stop loss increases.
- When price meet stop loss, then exit 100% of position.

2) Exit condition (stop loss is updated) (SAME AS strategy 2)

== Strategy 4

	volume > avrg * 1.5
- Close price should be CROSS OVER the EMA 200 curve
	crossover(close, ema)

=======================================================================
Entry conditions are different for each strategy, so these are independent each other.
The main idea of these strategies are dynamically increasing(LONG) stop loss, to prevent loss of shades.
